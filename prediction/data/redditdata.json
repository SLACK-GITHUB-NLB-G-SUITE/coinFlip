Have you ever held an investment account or actually had more than $5,000 of money you could classify as \"can afford to lose\"?  Because if you haven't, then your penchant for victim-blaming is sickening.\n\nLet me clearly respond on some common misconceptions and accusations:\n\n1) \"You're a dumb ass for sending that much money into an unregulated market.\" [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rfwec/warning_do_not_send_any_large_sums_to_coinbase/dswwedi/) [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rfwec/warning_do_not_send_any_large_sums_to_coinbase/dsx4qmt/)\n\nNo. Coinbase is not unregulated. Companies that facilitate crypto-to-fiat trade or crypto-to-crypto trade are not unregulated.  Every company is operating under the same rules as everyone else when it comes to property ownership and anti-fraud practices.  BITCOIN IS PROPERTY.  The US (and most) governments don't dispute this.  They fucking *tax* you on it.  \n\nWhat's unregulated is that there are no laws in place as to WHO can trade, how much can be traded, when trade can be halted, etc. This is self-regulated by each individual exchange.  HEAVENS OH NO THE WILD WEST!  What will we do without the SEC telling us we're not accredited investors, so we don't deserve real time order books and access to the best deals?  \n\nYou don't need regulation to legitimize commerce.  Bitcoin exists. Some people want more of it than others.  It's the very overregulated, antiquated and corrupt fiat monetary system that inhibits people from using bitcoin (by preventing the onramp).  \n\nWiring money to a company that agrees to be custodian of that money until you use it for trade does not mean, \"Hey they ran off with it, too bad, it's not illegal!\" You fucking moron.\n\n2) \"You're an idiot for sending SO MUCH MONEY ($10k, $40, $100k,...) Why would you send more than $100?\"\n\nHow insulated and close-minded or immature are you that you can't see beyond your own financial limits?  First, there are many people from very modest starts who believed in bitcoin early and are now millionaires.  Whether they have btc in paper wallets or still on exchanges they originally bought it, they now may want to USE OR MOVE some of it.    Then there are already people of means who are also investing.  How do you think the \"price\" of bitcoin is actually determined?  BY PEOPLE TRADING IT.  And it's not from $100 at a time.  \n\nAnyone who says, \"You're dumb for trading 'that much'\" or \"Why would you want to keep 'that much' on an exchange\" is so utterly ignorant of the concepts of liquidity and valuation.  Why is bitcoin not \"to the moon\"?  Partly because of the complete false yet accepted sentiment that investors should expect to lose their money because institutions that facilitate trade are \"allowed\" to negligently or willfully lose customer funds.\n\nUgh I can't keep typing.  Just stop blaming the victims of exchanges.  If it wasn't for fucking regulation, there would be 1,000 Coinbases and the shitty ones would be out of business.  But instead we're stuck with two \"credible\" ones in the US, who are a combination of tied up in regulatory hassle, overloaded, and mismanaged.

This accord granted to the Catholic Church the full ownership and sovereign authority over 44 hectares of land, located within the Rome city's limits.\n\nThe Vatican City state is one of the few remaining World's absolute monarchies. This monarchy is not hereditary and his ruler is elected by cardinals. The Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, which consists of cardinals appointed by Pope, exercises a full legislative authority within a holy realm. Executive power belongs to the President of that commission. Everyone of a thousand Rome's citizens is one of high positioned Catholic church's bureaucrats, which are personally assigned to his/ her post by Pope.\n\nThe officially recognized constituents of Vatican's GDP are trades of tourist memorabilia, museums' fees and books sales. However, the main engine of Holy See's economy is the infamous \"Istituto per le Opere di Religione\" (IOR), a.k.a. the Vatican Bank, which business among other things included participating in international tax evasions schemes and providing more than one-point-four billion dollars in unsecured loans to Latin American dictators. Today, largely thanks to the world-wide activity of IOR, subjects of Vatican City State, which per-capita exceeds four hundreds thousands dollars, enjoy the highest standard of living on the planet.\n\nIndependent and well-informed observers have already recognized the existence of Holy See's long-term and intimate relationships with foreign currencies. Now it also includes crypto. In April 2016 Vatican City was rumored to introduce the first sovereign decentralized crypto-currency. Those plans, however, remain unfulfilled. Still, due to the absence of legal acts regulating this sphere, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs is legal in Vatican.\n\nBusiness Notes for Startups Founders:\n\npolitical climate: n/a;\neconomic climate: n/a;\nregions to focus: n/a;\nindustries to focus: n/a;\nmajor limitations: the unique state;\nstimulus: n/a;\nopportunities: n/a;\nCryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (positive).\nThe author: Svyatoslav (Svyat) Sedov\nAngel investor and founder of The First International Incubator for Silicon Valley Companies (FirstInternational.In) in the Bay Area, CA, USA.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SvjatoslavSedof", "views": null, "likes": null}, "comments": [{"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "> This monarchy is not hereditary\n\nCelibacy is not compatible with heredity", "likes": null}]}, {"time": "2018-01-20 18:34:31", "title": "BTC/USD - Chart Analysis & Progress Report Jan.19,2018", "content": {"upvote": 0, "downvote": 0, "text": "", "views": null, "likes": null}, "comments": []}, {"time": "2018-01-20 18:25:22", "title": "Interesting article on BTC from 2011.

Wouldnt you need Tricky Dick Nixon Fun Bucks (USD$) to continue the complacent consentual based system of \"slavery\" we call fear of loss? Cypherpunks had a say in this creation, without a doubt. In fact, I think it was the guy that created RSA(RAS?) encryption or helped develop PGP encryption that was thrown in jail for creating a good encryption protocol under pretenses of international weapons/arms trafficking that must have  resonated in the bitcoin protocol creator's minds. I believe Vinny Gupta talks of this in UlteriorStates. Cryptography after all is seen by the authorities as a weapon. lol To get around this cryptographers share information legally, not software which is illegal??? Usually by printing or copying a piece of software's source code will skirt this restriction. The people behind bitcoin studied this thoroughly, Merkle, Diffie, Helmand(?), etc's work. Its why bitcoin utilizes merkle trees, pgp encryption & public and private key  (unidirectional) encryption protocols. Taking the banks out would not be in NSA/DOJs best interests. At this point its the old saying: \" if you cant beat them join them\" type logic. If its not running through their minds (DOJ) now then they must still think they can flashbang and raid a math problem into submission or threaten imprisonment on a number \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd23 maybe indict the MIT team behind its open source software licensing so they can guarantee a warranty canary with licensing restrictions in silence. Isnt that what happened with TOR and one of its developers/creators? If I recall correctly the difference is that they utilized the developer (an individual person) through an indictment/subpoena to appear in court as a point of pressure for the program, i.e. install a backdoor security flaw or zeroday in TOR software protocol or we go after you, your livelihood, your loved ones, & your freedom. Bitcoin is resilient to this in some degrees, but if a similar approach were to be used to pressure MIT directly or an individual bitcoin core developer then we will be very thankful for majority consensus rules & protocols, rendering the attempt a useless waste of resources & more importantly, squandering the precious time available. That said, from my understanding, and this is the beautiful part: if im correct, all financial, banking, trade, government, law enforcement, etc (all besides military) based digital data storage systems/servers use SHA256 bit encryption. This means if bitcoins encryption is prematurely broken, before we vote in concensus for SHA512 or SHA1024/1028? bit encryption protocols to be implemented, then it puts a green light in all the black hats and nation state cyber hacker teams that all the money in any system globally can now be broken into/will be broken into for someone has already done it. Not just bitcoin/alts but all financial storage systems for fiat/forex/stocks as well. To break bitcoin you break all of 'the system's' security as well. Anyone who can add to or correct any of this feel free. Military, to my knowledge, use 512 and higher as the standard today for basic/non-sensitive data. Either way trying to crack the btc protocol without trampling the other industries encryption is like a soldier standing on a bouncing betty with his enemy 1 foot length ahead of his own feet, take one out and both go down simultaneously.

With that in mind, there are many ways to minimize your tax liability if you have a significant holding in bitcoin or any other crypto currency.\n\nImagine many of the concepts and recommendations given by financial planners and tax experts to an individual that has won a large lottery jackpot still applies in this scenario.\n\nLets say for example you have 5000 BTC and a big smile on your face, it would be ridiculously stupid to cash out any large amounts above $470,700 as Uncle Sam would be using the largest condom he has to rape you. If you cash out lets say 10 million in BTC, you're going to be paying nearly a little over 4 million in tax if you're in an taxable income state. If you're in NY or Cali then you should just move unless you don't mind giving boat loads of money to politicians that spend it on everything under the sun.\n\nLets say you take that same 10 million dollars and you were to cash out as an S Corp, lets say for example; Nakamoto's Cafe, Inc.\n\nBecause this is a pass through tax structure in which case any money that you invest into the business is a tax write off (for the most part). At which case you and your spouse become employees of Nakamoto's Cafe and each take a nice salary of $200,000 per year in which case the first 120k is taxed with Social Security. Your company will provide you and your spouse with 100% benfitits paid health insurance, life insurance, dental, vision and a very nice 401k with 100% match up to the maximum federal limit at currently $18,500 for a total of 37k yearly contributions tax deferred.\n\nYour company is so great that they even provide you with a residence to pay rent free and covers all property taxes and utilities. Also very nice luxury company vehicles are provided to the executives with insurance covered and fleet gas card.\n\nYour company provides you with lavish first class airfare when you travel for your business purposes ;) such as managing your bitcoin portfolio while sipping some coke and rum on the beach of Fiji.\n\nThe company of course provides very nice computers and mobile devices so you can run maintain your business anytime anywhere.\n\nUltimately there will be a time where you have to pay money on taxes for pass through distributions, in which case if you manage your money correctly you will not have any distributions and will be able to maintain your lifestyle the way you like.

Once you've got it, you can make your payments as often as you like to the coffee shop (or to anyone else on the network).\n\nIf you allow your friends to use you as a route to the coffee shop, they can use up your channel in that direction.

Second, if for some reason you know you won't be used as a \"from\" route, you can just turn off routing in order to preserve your liquidity for your use only. And thirdly, it is unlikely that you'll only have one route to your coffee shop. You'll likely have several routes to the coffee shop via other channels with other entities.

For example, as I'm writing I see bitcoin at 13k on Yobit, whereas they are at 11.3k on Coinbase. Anyone knows why?\n\nI understand that markets in bitcoin are not as liquid and efficient as, say, the stock market. Also, different charges apply on different markets. But still, Yobit is consistenly around 15% off relative to other platforms (this is also true for all other currencies). Can inefficiency and charges alone justify such a huge spread?\n\nIt would seem to me that this makes it impossible to cash out of Yobit without taking a significant loss. As far as I understand, if I have a USD balance on Yobit, the only way to cash out is to convert it in bitcoin (or another currency) and then transfer it to a platform which allows withdrawals; but, even if the transfer occured instantly, I would still be buying coins at 100% on Yobit and then converting them into USD at around 85% on another platform.\n\nAny ideas?

In your scenario, I'm going to assume a few things, so if you had a different idea of how it works, hopefully I can clear it up, or feel free to ask more questions.\n\nI'm going to assume you already have bitcoin in your trezor. I'm going to also assume you use coinbase as an exchange. \n\nSo right now, you have bitcoin on chain. Right? \n\nNext, you want to open a lightning channel. So you can buy, groceries? Your VPN subscription? Tip online. Gamble? Whatever. So, to do that, you need to open a channel with a peer. That peer, could be anyone. Likely, coinbase will allow people to open channels with them. It's a logical step that exchanges will allow btc to be transferred into a lightning channel. So, you can use your trezor, to open a channel with them. It will take an on block transaction to do this. Alternatively, exchanges may allow you to withdraw from their web wallets, into a channel. \n\nYou still with me? This on chain transaction opens a channel. It requires a few confirmations to be accepted on LN as open. Then, through this channel, you can interact with the lightning network.\n\nNow, in this channel, let's say it has 1 btc in it. You can spend, up to 1 btc to one or many many places with very little fees. So, spending it all in one transaction, probably doesn't make the most sense. Why not just send it on the block chain? The bang for the buck goes when you're making many smaller payments. Now, 1btc, is a lot of money, I just used a number, and I'm not going to go back and change it. In the current state, that amount isn't even possible right now, but can be changed later. \n\nIf you were done with the channel and want your money back on your trezor, you would need to close the channel. This is another on chain transaction that requires a fee. \n\nHowever, with mass adoption, closing a channel could be uneeded. The exchanges will likely maintain balances in channels, and instead of withdrawing and opening a channel, they can send additional funds to your channel and top you off. So, you could buy more btc at an exchange and they top you off. \n\nPeople selling bitcoin, could send funds into the exchange channel, and not need to wait for confirmations to sell on the market. \n\nYou could accept money from a friend on the lightning network. Reimburse you for that hot dog stand that only takes cash? (That's so 2017) He hops onto his lightning wallet, scans your invoice, and transfers you over a couple thousand satoshis for lunch.\n\nHow is that? I'm trying to tell it like a story to help.

The extra nonces laying around from failed attempts at finding the previous block will generate previous block hashes uniformly distributed and above the current, and generated at the previous difficulty so block n+1 will always lag, and the hashes will almost always be there, leftover from before. \n\nThe system could be configured so miners would virtually never have to go back and re-hash the previous block: somebody would have a valid nonce for it under the aux difficulty algorithm, especially if some simple rule like previous_nonce_commitment_difficulty = difficulty_previous_block * (k<1) were implemented. (or a difficulty algorithm that caps below prev_block_diff * k) This would ensure that there are probably multiple nonces generated in the previous mining epoch which would satisfy the criterion with configurable probability...

Accounts/Balances/Addresses, all of these are terms to add confidence & comfort to a tech that doesnt work like these terms/concepts in a traditional way/sense in/of application to the banking/financial systems, the obsolescence to add comfort to a new realm for those who arent ready for the future.

Segwit could have not changed the weighting at all and then it would not be a capacity increase, but just a malleability fix, quadratic sighash fix, script versioning addition, P2SH hash algo upgrade, and input value signing improvement.

That's promising. And when they not only talk about the opportunities, but also about the risks involved, they are doing a great job.\n\n> What chances do you see in cryptocurrencies?\n\nA: A new industry could be created, which could mean growth and new jobs. That's quite possible. The first iteration is partially successfull, partially less successfull; A lot of learnings are made in the field.\n\n> Many state officials are critical when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

If not, I'm sure new interesting ideas come up.\n\n> Do you already own any Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies?\n\nA: No, I don't have any.

This makes it a perishable good, even though digital, and legally qualifying it as a commodity works to serve this functionality. Future coins will, if not sufficiently altered, act the same, and carry a similar value structure which grows over time, peaks at a significant value in which the person wishing to make a volume of transactions trades out his one highly valuable coin for many, many smaller ones. The old \"big\" coins retain their value and find their use in high value transactions rather than volume based ones. The lower value coins will find their use case in the volume trades, until they also become too rare to do so, at which time they will find their place as a \"high store of value\" but not efficient for trading in volume, currency/commodity. The system will store as far back as necessary, unlike money, which simply inflates ad infinitum with checks and balances that are hardly as effective. It's democratic in that people decide the next coin, but the one that came first will always be that, attaining and holding that value, and those that stick to that design will gain value in a linear fashion, except where a coin offers a unique use case.

The following is my contribution to Lightning Network, a critique of its onion routing implementation. I offer this not as a complaint, but as a falsifiable explanation of the issues as I understand them.\n\nThe privacy of Lightning transactions is highly questionable. Onion routing on Lightning Network provides far less privacy assurance than it does on Tor, and the ability for intermediaries to control routing decisions opens the potential for them to deanonymize senders or receivers. In particular, [BOLT #4: Onion Routing] (https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md) makes the following claims regarding the privacy it affords routed transactions.\n\n* Intermediate hops cannot know about the other hops in a route other than their immediate predecessor and successor.\n* Intermediate hops cannot know their position in the route.\n* Intermediate hops cannot know if their predecessor is the originator or their successor the receiver of the transaction.\n\nThere exists conditions under which an intermediary hop most certainly **can know** these facts. These conditions are met in some of the most commonly cited use cases for Lightning Network. It may also be possible for an well funded adversary to manipulate the availability of channels on intermediary systems to influence or control route selection.\n\nThe failure is primarily in the mix-net features of routing. Although Lightning allows source routing, route options are restricted by the decisions of intermediaries. This is different than the intended use case for onion routing, where hops can be selected arbitrarily. The difference in topology can be seen by comparing the Tor white paper to the Lightning BOLT documentation.\n\nEvery node on Tor is connected (or has the potential to directly connect) with every other node:\n\n> The Tor network is an overlay network; each onion router (OR) runs as a normal user-level process without any special privileges. **Each onion router maintains a TLS [17] connection to every other onion router.** \n\n> [Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router - 4 The Tor Design (page 4)](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf)\n\nOn Lightning Network nodes must share a channel in order to route directly between them:\n\n> In the following example, it's assumed that a\u00a0*sending node* (origin node),\u00a0`n_0`, wants to route a packet to a\u00a0*receiving node*\u00a0(final node), `n_r`. First, the sender computes a route\u00a0`{n_0, n_1, ..., n_{r-1}, n_r}`, where\u00a0`n_0\u00a0`is the sender itself and\u00a0`n_r`\u00a0is the final recipient. **The nodes\u00a0`n_i` and\u00a0`n_{i+1}`\u00a0MUST be peers in the overlay network route.**\n\n> [BOLT #4: Onion Routing - Packet Construction] (https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md#packet-construction)\n\nFurthermore, transaction metadata leaks information that informs intermediaries of potential route options beyond their immediate neighbors. In particular, approximate knowledge of the value (slightly complicated by the inclusion of fees) is necessary for intermediaries to execute their relay function. However, the transaction value affects the suitability of prospective hops.\n\n[BOLT #7: P2P Node and Channel Discovery](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md) describes how nodes on Lightning Network learn about the channels that other nodes offer for routing.\n\n> To support channel discovery, peers in the network exchange\u00a0`channel_announcement`\u00a0messages, which contain information about new channels between two nodes. They can also exchange\u00a0`channel_update` messages, which update information about a channel.\u00a0\n\nBecause the state of channels is broadcast to all nodes, an intermediate node knows the very limited set of viable hops before their predecessor and after their successor. In the case where there is only one such hop, the intermediary can know with extraordinary confidence the network identity of `n_{i-2}` and/or `n_{i+2}`. If there are no viable channels to their predecessor or from their successor, the intermediary can know with extraordinary confidence that `n_{i-1} == n_0` or `n_{i+1} == n_r`, respectively, and consequently their own position in the route.\n\nAs Lightning is a decentralized network, nodes have absolute authority over which channels they maintain and make available for routing. Control of route options by intermediaries makes it possible to construct contrived routes via controlled or influenced nodes. As the intermediary control the set of hops to choose from and their actual availability for routing, routes that enter such a construct can only exit at points of the intermediary's choosing.\n\nFor these constructs to be of any use, we need to entice the targeted source or destination to route over them. The following strategies apply to either direction, with slight variation. They serve only as examples, other strategies may exist.\n\n* If the only channel a target has available is an entry to our construct, it will offer the only possible routes over which they can transact.\n* If our construct is one of several channels a target has available and they make themselves available for routing 3rd party transactions, we can degrade the availability and capacity of alternative channels while maximizing the availability of our shared channel by selectively routing transactions through the target.\n* If our construct shares several direct channels with the target, direct channels with other peers of the target, or can otherwise influence the routing options of the target's immediate neighbors and beyond, more strategies can be used to manipulate their routing decisions. \n* It is hypothesized that even indirect influence over a sufficient number of a target's peers can permit manipulation of their routing decisions with a high degree of reliability. \n\nWhat do these constructs enable?\n\n* Transaction pattern analysis\n* Partial-to-full source/destination decloaking, assisted by transaction value data leak\n* Disguised rent-seeking\n* Dynamic reconfiguration of route options and availability\n* Unknown evil things\n", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 2, "downvote": 0, "text": "If I think something is broken it's not my responsibility to fix it.

Transaction fees are paid to miners to process your transaction on the blockchain. Lightning network transactions do not ordinarily happen on the blockchain or use miners. You do not need to pay them, since you're not ordinarily using them.\n\n2/ The lightning network creates a new way to earn fees on bitcoin without being a miner, using a method that shares a couple similarities with the proof of stake system (though it also has significant differences from that system). It processes payments by passing along payment information through routing partners, who may charge a fee to route your payment. These routing partners compete with one another to offer the lowest fee structure. To become a routing partner you don't need to solve proof of work algorithms, because routing payments doesn't take a lot of computing power. Instead, you need to prove you have enough money to route payments for all your users, and stake that amount of money in bitcoin payment channels, whereupon you may begin charging competitive fees. This fee structure could make it easier for normal people to earn money on bitcoin without needing an enormous investment in computing hardware.\n\n3/ No, routing partners are unlikely to become like Visa, for several reasons. One is that it is much easier to disconnect from a routing partner and find a new one than it is to disconnect from Visa and find a new debit card issuer. Getting a new debit card from one of Visa's competitors takes several business days and it gives them access to your private information and your bank account. Routing partners do not get any of that, and it takes only a few minutes to disconnect from one you don't like and find a new one. Also, a routing partner can be anyone on the lightning network.

The SEC questioned how bitcoin\u2019s volatility and potential illiquidity would fit with funds that must calculate a fair market price for their portfolio at the end of every trading day and allow investors to easily cash out their shares.\n\n\u201cUntil the questions identified above can be addressed satisfactorily, we do not believe that it is appropriate for fund sponsors to initiate registration of funds that intend to invest substantially in cryptocurrency and related products,\u201d the SEC\u2019s director of investment management, Dalia Blass, wrote in the letter made public Thursday.\n\nSeveral ETF issuers have been racing to launch the first bitcoin fund amid a speculative frenzy for digital currencies, but the SEC has so far been skeptical. The agency has also expressed reservations about initial coin offerings, saying that many ICOs, in which a firm raises money from investors in exchange for a new coin, are securities sales that should comply with its investor protection rules.\n\nLast year, the SEC rejected two proposed ETFs that would directly own bitcoin, including one from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, arguing that the global market for the digital currency wasn\u2019t transparent enough to support sufficient oversight.\n\nSome fund companies hoped that the SEC might relent after two Chicago exchanges late last year launched futures contracts on bitcoin. Those contracts are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a smaller federal agency whose rules allow Wall Street to more easily market new products.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s order in the Winklevoss case in March had indicated that a liquid and regulated futures contract could strengthen the case to allow bitcoin ETFs. But under its new chairman, Jay Clayton, the SEC has taken a more hawkish stance toward products and conduct that could blow up and hurt retail investors. Wall Street\u2019s hopes for the SEC\u2019s approval were dashed last week when the regulator asked several firms to withdraw applications to launch ETFs backed by bitcoin futures.\n\n\nBitcoin vs. Regulators: Who Will Win?\nAs bitcoin has emerged from the underground world of nerds and criminals to become a mainstream investment, the risk of hacks and scandals has also blossomed. What's a government to do? The WSJ's Steven Russolillo travels the world (sort of) to see how regulators are responding to the remarkable rise of cryptocurrencies. Video: Sharon Shi and Crystal Tai\nThe SEC\u2019s letter outlined a series of questions that ETF and mutual-fund sponsors would need to answer to get the agency\u2019s blessing in the future for crypto funds. But it warned them not to look for loopholes that could allow them to offer new funds that track bitcoin or bitcoin futures. U.S. law allows mutual-fund companies with existing regulatory approvals to introduce new funds with minimal oversight, but the SEC warned it wouldn\u2019t be pleased if that avenue was tried to launch bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe would view that action unfavorably and would consider actions necessary or appropriate to protect Main Street investors, including recommending a stop order to the commission,\u201d Ms. Blass wrote.\n\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com and Asjylyn Loder at asjylyn.loder@wsj.com", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "Someone post the article, it\u2019s a soft paywall.", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "That's gonna leave a mark!", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "Ha, they make it sound like they are trying to protect people from making money.

Each step is tied together using a cryptographic key.\n\nThe process looks like this:\n\n1. Carol creates a secret.\n2. She scrambles the secret.\n3. She gives Alice the scrambled secret.\n4. Alice says to Bob \"I'll pay you 1.00001 mBTC if you can tell me the solution to this scrambled secret. You can get the solution from Carol for 1 mBTC. I'll pay you 0.00001 mBTC as a fee for your trouble.\"\n5. Alice signs a smart contract to that effect.\n6. Bob turns around and says to Carol \"I'll pay you 1 mBTC for the solution to this.\" and signs a similar contract.\n7. Carol gives Bob the solution and collects 1 mBTC.\n8. Bob now has the solution and gives it to Alice, collecting his 1.00001 mBTC\n\nBob can't sell the solution to Alice, until he first buys it from Carol. And Bob is assured by the smart contract that if he buys it from Carol he will be able to sell it to Alice. No one has to trust anyone.\n\nAll of that negotiating is done in the background by Alice, Bob, and Carol's respective Lightning nodes.\n\n---\n\nBut there's no reason each hop has to be in the same currency. If Alice only has bitcoin and Carol only accepts litecoin, Alice can pay Bob in bitcoin and Bob can pay Carol in Litecoin.\n\nOr it could loop back to Alice if Alice wants to trade Bitcoin for Litecoin. Alice pays Bob 1 mBTC and Bob pays Alice 60 mLTC.\n\nThe trading process would look like this:\n\n1. Alice creates a secret and scrambles it.\n\n2. She tells Bob the scrambled secret and creates a smart contract that pays Bob 1 mBTC if he can produce the secret.\n\n3. Bob sees this and creates a similar smart contract that pays Alice 60 mLTC if she produces the secret.\n\n4. Alice uses the secret to claim the litecoin, revealing the secret to Bob in the process.\n\n5.

The part that deals with the block-chain is the channels.  \nA and B throw money into a pot (they open a channel) and do business and decide who gets how much from the pot.  \n\nA total of 4 TX is done per channel. 2 transactions are done, 1 each person, to send money into the pot or channel. 2 more transactions are done when the channel closes and the money is given back to A and B. Miners get this portion of the fees as normal, as its still 4 transactions on the blockchain.  \n\nSharing a pot or channel allows for the 2 people to trade between each other as much times as they want with the money they put into the pot without it being settled on-chain until it closes. A can send money to B multiple times and vice versa. It only counts as the 4 transactions to make and settle the channel instead of having to put every single transaction onto the blockchain. Currently, reading the blockchain will show every transaction ever. With Lightning transactions, we will only see who gets how much from a channel settling, but not every single transaction that happened on the channel.   \n\nThe Network part of Lightning Network connects these channels so that if A and C have a channel with B, but A and C do not have a channel with each other, then A and C can trade with each other by using their connections with B instead of having to open another channel. The Lightning Network fees, if any, go to B for being the middleman in A-C transactions.  \n\nEverything will be encrypted to prevent bad actors.  A bad actor can still spam the mempool, but users being forced onto a channel is not a problem. The problem with mempool spamming is that they must pay fees. Which means they will burn a lot of money for very little if any damage. Ideally, most users will be using the Channel System, or Lightning Network, as it will allow almost infinite transactions to be done without being settled on-chain, but still being secured by decentralized encryption.

Irreversibility is what enables it to work without trust, oversight or governance. Its not a major selling point by itself, but it does have tangible advantages especially for companies that are plagued by credit card fraud.\n\n3 Re Fast; paypal or visa are not fast. Not if you are a retailer accepting them. It may take weeks before you get the money, and it takes 3+ months before the money actually clears. \n\n5 \"Permissionless\". This is so much broader than buying sex dolls. Billions of people dont have access to banking because they have no papers, ie, no permission. Many more cant start a business even just online and accept payment, because visa wont let them because of their credit rating, age, country of residence, whatever.

They use it as a safe haven because it's production is predictable and it's supply is also predictable, also the value it has is only determined by what we think about it; it's a global consensus defined by our minds, where no government has power, since they can't control our thoughts and can't hide the truth (broadly speaking).\n\nBitcoin has the same properties, the only value it has is what we give to it, but Bitcoin is superior in many aspects, because it's not physical and thus not hard to carry around. If you bought 1 billion of gold, because you needed a safe haven, and you wanted to transport it (for any reasons, like your country being in war for example), give it to someone else, etc.. you would have big troubles carrying that around, but with Bitcoin it would be as easy as few clicks in front of a computer to send that billion worth to anywhere in the world without anyone capable is prohibiting that.\n\nBitcoin also has a limited supply just as gold, and it's production rate is well defined by an algorithm which has been proven many times hard to change (S2X, and many other attemps to change it without consensus). \n\nBut governments also can't confiscate your Bitcoins as long as you have the keys. Nor like gold, where governments or bad actors, just need a tank in front of your bunker full of gold to take it all from you. \n\nAnd why there isn't any other asset like Bitcoin since there are a lot of cryptocurrencies? Well, Bitcoin has the biggest mining power, and you would need millions and millions of dollars to \"hack\" bitcoin, nor like other cryptos, where with few millions you would be able to double spend the transactions. But Bitcoin also has been proven resilient to many attacks from many parties, and everytime it survives one, it becomes more resilient. \n\nThere are many other arguments in favor of Bitcoin. \n\n", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "What about Bitcoin being a way to transfer money quickly from one country to another, both countries using a different fiat? \n\nI think on some day fiat money won't be crossing any borders anymore.

For one, it will routinely get frozen every 3 years until you provide IRS documents (or an IRS certificate of foreign status).\n\n- I've also had receiving payments stopped a few times while they ask for proof of address and business/identity documents. They seem to do it at least twice a year. Meanwhile, I lose a couple of days worth of business just from their slowness in responding.\n\n- I've used other online payment processors, and it's annoying how I needed to send ID after exceeding $1000 sent. Then had to provide ID AGAIN after another $1000 (and they stopped accepting anything other than a passport for that threshold, which I do not have, marking the end of my business with them).\n\n> 2) \"Irreversible\" Again, most people simply do not care. Ask yourself, how many times in your life that your payment or any sort of transactions got reversed? how frequent were there?\n\nYou sound like you have never run an online business.\n\nHave you ever run even a medium scale online business? I've gotten my fair share of chargebacks and they are the WORST.\n\n- I once had over 20 transactions (made over several months) charged back at the same time by a \"regular customer\". Was totally in danger of losing my merchant account just from that.\n\n- I've had a customer dispute a transaction, then say \"oops I didn't realize this payment was for that\" when I emailed them, then repeat the payment. Meanwhile, the previous chargeback gets a $20 chargeback FEE slapped on it, so I STILL lost money in the end.\n\nAn irreversible payment method like bitcoin sounds WONDERFUL to me (too bad not a lot of people actually use it on my store, like I get 1 btc payment for every 1000 usd payments).\n\n> 5) \"Permissionless\" How many times had you been stopped to perform a transaction?\n\nSeveral times, at the worst times.\n\n- Have you actually ever tried to wire/process/transfer more than $10,000? I did, my bank instantly threw an AML alert, threatened to freeze my account, and I had to go in to provide \"source of income\" documents and answer tons of questions.\n\n- One time I tried to deposit $2500 cash, the teller called the bank manager, they asked what the money was for, asked for ID to verify who I was and if I owned the account, and had me sign a piece of paper stating the purpose of the deposit along with scanning my ID.\n\n  It was terrible, I felt like I was being treated like a terrorist.\n\n- Have you ever run a reselling business, like dropshipping? I was in such a business once, and it involved paying high amounts repeatedly over Paypal ($500-1000 payments, around 2-3 times a week). After a couple of weeks, Paypal froze that account and asked for documents as this \"behavior\" was akin to \"laundering funds\" according to them and threw some alerts.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, your arguments sound like something from someone who has NEVER run an online business or accept a moderate amount of payments online. And from someone who has never dealt with a moderately large-sized amount of money with their bank or with Paypal.\n\nIt sounds like arguments from someone who entire experience is based on using their credit cards to buy stuff on eBay and Amazon, and possibly taking a payment once a month or two, when you sell something used on eBay.\n\nDefinitely not someone who has the experience to talk.\n\nHaving said that, bitcoin is NOT yet the solution to this.\n\nRight now barely anyone uses it (I don't really remember the last time I got a bitcoin payment, was it a couple of months ago? And I get more than 20 customers everyday).\n\nI like it more for its remittance properties. Being able to store and transmit LARGE sums of money without getting a bunch of probes up your ass, wanting to know where the money is from and who you are sending it to, like you are some drug lord funding some terrorists.\n\nIf only it had more stability and greater adoption, it would be amazingly great for that purpose.\n\n> IF and only IF, Bitcoin value act like what USDT is at 1USD per Bitcoin with no supply cap, do you think most people would still buy Bitcoin??\n\nOH DEFINITELY.\n\nIf it was permanently pegged to a certain value, that eliminates ALL of the volatility.\n\nMeanwhile, if it remains uncensorable (meaning no one can freeze my accounts, or block my transactions), global (so that I can pay anyone in the middle of Africa while on my bed), and trustless and decentralized (meaning no central entity can seize or freeze funds).... that would be the ULTIMATE currency.\n\nBut if the peg is just like USDT (meaning it's backed only by Tether/Bitfinex and their guarantee), then no. I don't fully trust USDT.\n\nNot because of the rumors of insolvency/fractional banking/printing tethers.\n\nI just don't trust centralized entities anymore after encountering Paypal and their account freezing shenanigans, or banks and their \"alerts\".", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "Why do you think people keep buying gold?

I think there is a good chance that it won\u2019t be THAT bad and at least 1 coin (prob BTC) will hold steady or rise in value because of it. Here\u2019s my thought train:\n\n1) Tethers are traded with a relatively few number of higher cap coins, which themselves have deep markets. BTC-USDT is only 10ish %. Yes, the loss of trading volume could hurt these coins, but my bet is that fresh fiat is a stronger driver of upward price. The FUD would have to be truly outsized on this to crash the prices. Reddit groupthink says that if the value of fiat crashes, then BTC would at a minimum go up. Why not with tethers? Halting yuan-BTC trading paused the market, but it did not crash it. Why would tether imploding be different?\n\n2) There needs to be a safe haven trade. During a crypto-shock event, people want a safe haven trade, and tethers thus far have provided this. If you are on a fiat trading exchange, then great, you can cash out to fiat. On exchanges such as Binance, without tethers I bet the market will choose a new safety trade or trades. Sure, many people will sell into BTC/ETH/LTC so that they can then transfer to a fiat exchange, but I bet a significant portion of people will sell into a safe haven coin and hodl or the market gets over it in short order.\n\nAgain, I think there would be a shock, but I seriously doubt it would be a serious crash.

I commend you for logical thinking on at least one point. My main problem with your post is that I disagree with your premise that bitcoin has no utility. If I agreed that bitcoin has no utility, I would agree that its value is dependent on speculation. I also agree that utility is essential. I think bitcoin has utility in many ways: its method of processing payments has utility, its support for contractual payments has utility, its ability to store information has utility, its privacy has utility, its miners have utility, and its proof of work has utility.\n\nApart from that, I also want to note three things: first, if by \"P2P\" you mean \"peer to peer,\" bitcoin has that. Second, I think all assets, as well as all stocks, and all national currencies, as well as bitcoin, suffer from a common problem: sellers and shorters can lower the value of any asset, stock, or currency, simply by selling it for less than the spot price. But nonetheless I don't think it's fair to say that investors won't or shouldn't invest in an asset that this can happen to. (Not claiming that that's your position btw.) Even though third parties can lower the value of bitcoin by selling it, there is a very common reason why risk-averse institutions might invest, and it's the same reason they invest in other things that this can happen to: if their confidence that the price will go up outweighs their fear of the risk that it will go down, they will invest.\n\nThird, I think bitcoin has intrinsic value which comes from its proof of work. I am confident you disagree with me. I also think it trades at a value that is currently higher than its intrinsic value by a relatively large margin. It's difficult to go further down this train of thought because I am confident you disagree with my starting assumption. But since I think bitcoin has intrinsic value, I also think this intrinsic value helps support the higher value it trades at, the value which speculators give it.

This is essential for bitcoin to operate as a currency, a medium of exchange, as it was intended and designed. \n\nCore has changed the form of bitcoin to the point where it\u2019s current form no longer represents what was designed in the white paper. First, this is important because when we define an ideal, such as a tree or a dog, we use constructs like form. We can identify a tree or dog, in part, by observing its form. A tree is shaped like a tree. A dog is shaped like a dog. Secondly, its intention/capacity. Form alone is not sufficient to identify an ideal, thus we look at an objects intention/capacity. A tree has roots that take in fluid to hydrate and sun for photosynthesis. A dog has its own nature as well. A dog  as well has its own capacity for dog things, for lack of a better term and simplicity\u2019s sake. Thirdly, matter is the last category used to define the ideal. This is,\u201dwhat is said.\u201d That is the sound the language, if capable, used by the ideal. Again, all 3 of these things are fully described in the white paper. The white paper would be like apple\u2019s corporate charter that details the major components of the company such as its objectives(Intention), its structure(Form) and its planned operations(Matter). What if Apple suddenly decided to no longer sell computers and decided to sell houses. That would change all 3 criteria and Apple wouldn\u2019t be what Apple was that changed the world. It would be completely different even though it kept the name.

The trustless, highly secure  repository for the majority of your wealth.

Likewise, using small amount of BTC converted into BCH through LN implemented BTC<=>BCH will be transparent, efficient, and completely accepted by a complete network devoid of requirement to set up a payment channel or stumble upon a route through several of them.\n\nThis is a solution where everyone wins.

I think the biggest value from Lightning won't be lowering mining fees, but making Bitcoin practical and cheap largely regardless of mining fees.\n\nWe can break transactions down by value into three groups:\n\n1. Transactions that are too big for Lightning. They will always be on-chain and can afford the highest fees. (We can also include opening and closing transactions in with this group since they have to be on chain.)\n\n2. Transactions that are small enough to be practical on Lightning, while being large enough to be worth the on chain fee if there was no Lightning. These are the transactions that will move from on chain to Lightning.\n\n3. Transactions that are too small to be practical on chain. These will only happen on Lightning. They won't have any effect on mining fees because they never would have been on chain anyway. They will be irrelevant to the blockchain but very relevant to Lightning.\n\nThe amount that transaction fees fall will depend on the ratio between groups 1 and 2. If group 1 is large enough to keep blocks full then fees won't fall much. The threshold between 1 and 2 depends on how much liquidity people are willing to put into Lightning. It will start small, but should go up over time as trust in Lightning grows. It will cap out at some point when most hot wallet funds are in Lightning.\n\nThe utility of Lightning will attract users and demand for BTC. More users means more channels being opened and closed. More demand means higher price and more value that can generate more group 1 transactions. At some point the higher demand driving more group 1 transactions will catch up to the increasing Lightning liquidity that moves transactions from group 1 to group 2, and on chain fees will start going back up again.\n\nGroups 2 and 3 will make Bitcoin more useful with the same or higher mining fees.", "views": null, "likes": null}, "comments": [{"upvote": 2, "downvote": 0, "text": "You may also want to consider the use case for the transactions. Some transactions are likely to stay on-chain regardless of value due to other qualities or requirements.\n\nFor instance, transactions that would result in a net increase in total coin ownership (i.e. the receivers total channel funding increases) require the creation or expansion of a channel via an on-chain transaction. A practical example: Alice is a dedicated hodlr who practices dollar cost averaging, buying $100 worth of BTC every Friday evening. Alice knows that BTC is headed for the moon, she wouldn't think of spending her Lambo funds when she could instead spend depreciating fiat. And she certainly isn't going to keep her coin on an exchange! Lightning is probably not much use to Alice and performing her buys on-Network wouldn't necessarily prevent any on-chain transactions. Since Alice's total coin ownership is constantly increasing, she would need a new channel every time her existing channels are depleted in her direction. Her exchange, or another liquidity provider, may be willing to fund her initial channel with more coin than she purchases, but they would be committing those additional funds to a channel that will not see much use. This would impose a cost to the channel peer that they would need recoup.\n\nAnother type of transaction that may remain on-chain regardless of value are those that require strong disassociation through pseudoanonymity. Lightning Network trades reduced pseudoanonymity for increased privacy of transaction information (of which Bitcoin's public ledger provides *none*). Users may not find this trade-off advantageous depending on the specific requirements of their use case.\n\n", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 2, "downvote": 0, "text": "I'm just a diesel mechanic so I can't do anything to push the lightning network forward but I'm very excited to see it implemented.

It's taken a couple years of effort but I've managed to get just about every mechanic on my shift into bitcoin. When one of us makes a fast food run I often pay with bitcoin using the pay by email address feature that's offered by Coinbase.

You could have a channel that has enough capacity, and still be unable to pay someone if you can't find any connecting channels with enough capacity.\n\nThe total capacity of the channel is chosen when the channel is opened.

You can transact with anyone else connected to the network.\n* the idea that on-chain fees (i.e. to open/close LN channels) will remain at the current ridiculous levels is an unreasonable assumption that ignores all the scaling currently in progress to combat that very problem\n* the idea that channels would be regularly opened/closed is incorrect - most people would keep their channel(s) open indefinitely\n\nThere is no 'locking up'. This is FUD spread by those who don't like LN as a scaling solution.\n\nIf you take money out of your bank account and put it in your wallet, would you consider that 'locking it up'? No, you're actually making your money more usable.\n\nWith BTC in a wallet, you can make payments via the blockchain (slow, requires non-neglible fees, requires confirmations, not very private). With BTC in LN, you can make cheap, instant, more private payments to anyone on the LN network (which, at least theoretically, will be anyone with bitcoin).\n\nIf for some reason you need your BTC back in a standard wallet, you just transfer it back with a regular bitcoin transaction. You'd only really need to send money back to a regular wallet for saving/storage, so waiting for an on-chain transfer is never going to be a concern. The only other scenario for wanting to move money back to a wallet if to then make an on-chain payment with the funds...which is an odd edge case, as it would almost always make more sense to make the payment via LN.\n\n\n\n1) You don't have to open a channel with everyone in town. Just a few channels might be sufficient. This is the \"network\" part of the \"lightning network\", if you want to pay someone, but don't have a direct channel with them, you can send the payment through one of your existing channels, which will forward the payment hopping through other people's channels until it reaches its destination. (ex: You have a channel with Alice, you want to pay Bob, but you do not have a channel with Bob. However Alice & Bob are connected, so you send the payment to Alice, and ask her to forward it to Bob on your behalf). Best of all, this happens in a trustless and non-custodial manner, i.e. intermediate nodes cannot steal the in-transit payment (thanks to a cryptographic contract called the \"Hashed Time-Lock Contract\").\n\n\nAlso, you do not need to fill a channel with everything you expect to spend, because you can refill the channel through the network. Example: You open a $20 channel with Starbucks, you spend everything. Then let's say someone pays you through Lightning for some small service, their payment can arrive through your Starbucks channel which will now be refilled. Sweet, more coffee! (or something else, you don't necessarily have to use that channel only to pay Starbucks)\n\n\n2) No need to close a channel to spend coins in it. If Starbucks wants to spend the coins they received from your channel, they can pay someone else using you as a router. (ex: they refill your channel, and in exchange you use some other channel of yours to route their payment to someone of their choice). The only reason to close a channel is if the other party become unresponsive, which hopefully would be infrequent enough to not be a huge problem.\n\n\nEven in that case, in the future we will have \"channel factories\" which are a way to open/close payment channels off-chain, which will further optimize and reduce the costs of the whole process, dramatically reducing the need to pay miner fees.\n\nIt's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). There is no way in a million years it'll scale onchain. Bitcoin will work without 2nd layer solutions, but the 'cash' component will come with that adoption.\n\nRoger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.\n\nNo. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.\n\nWhat you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.\n\n", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 6, "downvote": 0, "text": "I hate to break it to you but bcash is just an altcoin with slighty less shitty tech than bitcoin(in current state).

And I also know I can get 'recharged' on LN, but as I currently do not earn BTC on mainnet or the LN network, I have to recharge directly, so thats where I would take the re-occuring financial hit.\n\nFully agree that *Bitcoin* in it's current form needs a 2nd tier solution. The bcash bandaid is short sighted, and if that's all Ver et al really wanted they could have co-opted a better coin like LTC or Doge.\n\nWhat will the fees be on mainnet after lightning? Impossible to estimate. If I were to take a guess, block size will remain low as long as possible. Assuming current adoption levels I would be shocked if the fees are smaller this time next year if the block size stays where it is, regardless of LN adoption. \n\nAnecdotally I've been in tech long enough to see the unseatable, unseated, including when it's the technically better technology.", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 6, "downvote": 0, "text": ">I hate to break it to you but bcash is just an altcoin with slighty less shitty tech than bitcoin\n\nNo shit, I've been saying that for ages.

Seeking brave alpha tester", "content": {"upvote": 55, "downvote": 0, "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nafter the big news yesterday that lightning charge by the elements group is out I am helping my fiancee's sister who is running a medium sized webshop for a living to add bitcoin as a form of payment. She is very happy to do so and promised to HODL all revenue made via Bitcoins (sorry I have to brag that she must have great influence (; ). However her product is rather cheap (only a few bucks) so without lightning it didn't make sense to accept bitcoin because fees would have been higher that the price for the product. \n\nAfter the great help and suggestions by /u/cdecker on the IRC yesterday and today (kudos and shoutout to him!) I knew the roadmap: \n* I set up a virtual machine on amazon elastic cloud (actually a friend did this who is doing this on a regular basis. Thanks Heinrich!)\n* We set up my very first bitcoin node (bitcoin core 0.15 which worked pretty easy! Amzing good processes and workflows)\n* We set up my very first lighting node. (which also turned out to be pretty straight forward) \n* We had everything on testnet and I am currently running on mainnet (however bitcoind is still downloading and verifying the blockchain)\n\nWe have several problems though at the last step in which case the needed technology stack is kind of out of our comfort zone: \n1. I can't set up lightning charge following this tutorial: https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning-charge (I know it's ridiculous but I am not living in the javascript / node.js world, so I am having problems with user rights when running npm. If anyone would be willing to have a look (maybe via skype screenshare session it would be great!)\n2. I currently don't have any hot wallet coins on the bitcoin node since this is my very first node and I am kind of afraid to transfer my funds. As far as I understand, I do not really need bitcoins myself to fund lightning channels as long as the other lightning nodes open and fund the channels (which is the preferred way anyway, since a webshop is obviously only accepting BTC and has basically only incoming payments over the long turn).

U also need to take note of the percentage allocation.\n\nSo if u choose to do top 10 and divide equally, then that's 10% each...  now listen, as time moves forward, some of those coins may drop out of top 10, also the percentages will start to skew (some will hold 20%, while some will have 5% in relation to ur total present value)... u will have to do re-balancing.. \n\nTo rebalance, u need to sell off the coins that are not on the top 10 anymore, buy the top 10 newcomers, and u also need to set each coin at 10% allocation again... an easier way of doing this is to simply liquidate all ur holdings and buy the top 10 again with the right allocation.\n\nHow often do u need to rebalance?\n\nThat's up to u... it could be monthly, quarterly, once a year... the only problem with doing it too often is the transaction fees...\n\nKey point: doing indexing is less risky as u are not betting on bitcoin, but rather u are now betting that the cryptomarket will continue to grow... also, this will prevent u from getting too emotionally involved with a coin...\n\nPros: safer as betting on the idea that crypto market as a whole will continue to grow is less riskier than betting on bitcoin alone.\n\nCons: if bitcoin remains king in the end, u won't get as much value compared to betting on bitcoin alone...\n\n\nTips:\n\n* don't attempt to time the market unless u know what u are doing... been trading for years and I'm only right around 50% of the time...if u can get 60%, ur already considered a rockstar in forex markets.\n\n* in trading, the biggest factor is mental fortitude and discipline. I suggest u practice meditation so ull learn how to pull ur mind out of anything, including worrying about the price.\n\n* if ure too worried, or u can't sleep...that means ur overexposed basing on ur personal risk tolerance.. reduce ur position until u can sleep...\n\nDisclaimer: These are just tips and not a formal financial advise...\n\n\n", "views": null, "likes": null}, "comments": [{"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "hello from r/forex!\n\n", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "What your crypto:forex ratio at?", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "[deleted]", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "Hahaha... hello there.. sadly I don't hangout in forex or thread for years now...

It's much, much quicker and cheaper to swap these certificates around. Every certificate is digitally signed by the owners of the underlying asset.

I believe many of you will agree with me when I say that we can not use 1 whole bitcoin as a unit of measure of its value, but rather 1 satoshi. That truth be told, making payments with bitcoin fractions and taking as the main unit of measurement an entire bitcoin has become very complicated over the years with the growth of currency value. Time goes by, things change and we have to adapt to the environment so that we continue to evolve. We all know that the price of bitcoin is down to what it really should be due to the available supply, but for a beginner who is not aware of these details, it is understandable that he thinks he is too expensive because he can not afford to buy too many. on account of which many look for \"cheap\" coins instead of all using a single coin. We all want to have lots of money units, no matter what the money, and it's a bit discouraging to own fractions. Satoshi divided Bitcoin into a smaller unit of measure so that when the mass adoption day came we would have no problems with these fractions and could take the lowest value (Satoshi) as the main unit of measurement for bitcoin.\n\nMy proposal is to reach consensus on changing our measure from bitcoin (21.000.000 supply) to its supply in satoshi (2.100.000.000.000.000)\n\nPlease be honest and tell me what do you prefer:\n\n\nUse case 1: Hello sir, here is your coffee, it's 0,00000002 bitcoins\n\nUse case 2: Hello sir, here is your coffee, it's 2 satoshis\n\n\ntldr: Bitcoin is cheap, make it look cheap by changing our ways to measure its supply from bitcoin itself to satoshi, it's not easy to change but i think its a must!", "views": null, "likes": null}, "comments": [{"upvote": 6, "downvote": 0, "text": "Yeah, I think most people would agree that the whole fractions thing has to go.\n\nI was actually thinking about this more earlier today and felt the same way. 1 satoshi is far easier to comprehend.

But it has a caveat. Say you want to pay a 2-of-2 multisig of Alice and Bob. You ask what Alice's key is, and she says `A`. You ask what Bob's key is, and instead of replying `B`, he gives you `B-A` (the EC point difference between B and A). You now happily construct the sum of the two responses `A` and `B-A`, and unknowingly send your funds to just key `B` - which Bob can obviously spend without cooperation from Alice, breaking the 2-of-2 assumption.\n\nIn most scenarios, this is fixable. You ask Alice and Bob to each prove they have access to the public keys they claim to have (you require the keys to be \"certified\"). However, this makes the protocol more complicated and easier to screw up. Furthermore, it seems it's hard to prove schemes that rely on this certification to be secure.\n\nThe first paper that gave a Schnorr-like signature scheme that was provably secure against the above attack (without requiring certification of the keys) was Bellare-Neven in 2006. This is what \"Signers are only required to have a public key\" means. Unfortunately, Bellare-Neven does not permit you to compute a \"combined key\" ahead of time (meaning the verifier needs to see all the public keys, a bandwidth and privacy reduction).\n\nThe scheme we propose in the paper is novel in that it combines (A) the lack of need for certification of keys and (B) the ability to precompute a combined public key for a set of signers.

While the cryptocurrency market is more volatile and risky now, it will have the chance to extend much longer if the base moves more towards integrity than greed. \n\nVery tricky though, everyone has hopes & who wants to compromise for overall health in the market.

The speculation & market manipulation, fraud, theft, ponzis, pyramids, shills, investors in for only for volatile gains almost exist on another level. They use the system, but only so much as it gives them value to others misfortune. When the next punctuated evolution happens, they will easily flow on to the next bright thing, but can the harm be minimised. There are a lot of growth pains, slipping education, hanlon's razor.

That said, if someone came and tortured you they could get you to make a transaction, I'm sure. The risk of a hack was higher in the early days before mining power built up, and I think Dogecoin at some point experienced a few attempts at 51% attacks that were unsuccessful as well.

More transactions makes it easier to trace you because they can go, ok, so, these wallets exchange coins at these times and these were the confirmation nodes, which will have the IP information available. If you have only made one and then never confirmed with the network, technically you don't have possession of those coins yet, and could lose out on gaining them if you don't confirm with a node because, say, you don't confirm, and that person backtracks their log, and spends them, and months go by with no update from you, the system will go with whichever transaction went through first.

If they had operated less like 20th century socialist walled gardens, and instead allowed international transactions to operate freely like in well functioning economies elsewhere, then the local bitcoin price would not be at a premium.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that if in fact bitcoin is selling at a 20% premium, then what this means is that the government has actually inflated the KRW by 20% over what it's actual value should be. Only bitcoin exchanges (due to bitcoin being able to flow freely everywhere) show the correct value of the local currency.

Lets make that 0.01 for ease of calculation.\n\nIf BTC would, in the future, become mainstream so it corresponds to the same amout of cash we have today, then 1 BTC would end up being worth atleast 300.000 USD (0.01 = 3k USD remember)\n\nNow that may sound low but consider that in this example it's only your \"pocket money\"'s worth.\n\nIf we were to include the value of more than just the physical forms of money and factor in the total supply of money out there (Money in savings/checking accounts etc) that is easily accesible aka \"narrow money\", that comes to 36.7 Trillion USD (http://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017)\n\nSame procedure as above ((36.7B / 7.6B) = 4,828 USD x3 = $14,486 per capita in \"cash\") which would be what our equivalent of 0.01 BTC per capita is worth. (14,486 x 100 = 1 BTC)\n\nThat comes down to almost $1,5M USD per BTC in our imaginary future. Not so bad.\n\nTL;DR the current state of the market is nothing to worry about, and i suck at logic", "views": null, "likes": null}, "comments": [{"upvote": 3, "downvote": 0, "text": "You couldn't have an economy where the currency goes up in value.

If everyone was accepting LN as payment then it would matter little how high the fees because you would never need to worry about closing a channel and the cost of the fees would be amortized over many thousands of transactions.\n\nIn the early days, when there will be very few use cases, not being able to confirm a transaction on chain under a certain amount will be a strong disincentive to use. The utility of payment \"hubs\" increases exponentially with network size so at the beginning they won't be very useful at all.\n\nIf I use LN to accept a low level payment and then can't close the channel then that money is effectively locked unless I can find somewhere else on the LN to spend it, which in the early days will be less likely because there will be very few places accepting it. People will also be scared to keep any significant amount of money on it while its in early days and there might yet be security vulnerabilities.\n\nUtility doesn't scale linearly with transaction fee. At 10 cents to open a channel and 10 cents to close it there would be lots of microtransactions it would be instantly useful for regardless of the size of the network.

It consolidates transactions to be smaller.  Most of the data in a transaction is all the addresses.  This project will reduce those down to one address per transaction.  It will kill all this spam on the network.\n3 RSK Rootstock.  When Satashi published Bitcoin he made some changes before doing it.  Satashi actually developed complex Smart Contracts into Bitcoin, but he pulled the code for he felt it was too insecure for the purpose of Bitcoin.  All the OP Codes that is need are still there.

Lots of people chat about it. \n5 Onion Protocol;  Lightning Network incorporated another project that completely Privatizes transaction in the network called 'Onion' where Transactions only refer to the previous node and the next node a transaction takes to reach its Destination.  That eliminates tracking of where transactions come from.  This works only in Lightning Network Nodes for transaction will travel from Channel to Channel to Channel to reach its Destination.

I think it's cool. It kinda happened in Ireland in the 70s already. Here's a quote from Rutger Bregman's *Utopia for Realists*:\n\n>When Bankers Struck\n>\n>\"CLOSURE OF BANKS.\"\n>\n>On May 4, 1970, this notice ran in The Irish Independent. After lengthy but fruitless negotiations over wages that had failed to keep pace with inflation, Ireland's bank employees decided to go on strike.\n>\n>Overnight, 85% of the country's reserves were locked down. With all indications suggesting that the strike could last a while, businesses across Ireland began to hoard cash. Two weeks into the strike, The Irish Times reported that half of the country's 7,000 bankers had already booked flights to London in search of other work.\n>\n>At the outset, pundits predicted that life in Ireland would come to a standstill. First, cash supplies would dry up, then trade would stagnate, and finally unemployment would explode. \"Imagine all the veins in your body suddenly shrinking and collapsing,\" one economist described the prevailing fear, \"and you might begin to see how economists conceive of banking shutdowns.\" Heading into the summer of 1970, Ireland braced itself for the worst.\n>\n>And then something odd happened. Or more accurately, nothing much happened at all.\n>\n>In July, the The Times of England reported that the \"figures and trends which are available indicate that the dispute has not had an adverse effect on the economy so far.\" A few months later, the Central Bank of Ireland drew up the final balance. \"The Irish economy continued to function for a reasonably long period of time with its main clearing banks closed for business,\" it concluded. Not only that, the economy had continued to grow.\n>\n>In the end, the strike would last a whole six months -- 20 times as long as the New York City sanitation workers' strike. But whereas across the pond a state of emergency had been declared after just six days, Ireland was still going strong after six months without bankers. \"The main reason I cannot recollect much about the bank strike,\" an Irish journalist reflected in 2013, \"was because it did not have a debilitating impact on daily life.\"\n>\n>But without bankers, what did they do for money?\n>\n>Something quite simple: The Irish started issuing their own cash. After the bank closures, they continued writing checks to one another as usual, the only difference being that they could no longer be cashed at the bank. Instead, that other dealer in liquid assets -- the Irish pub -- stepped in to fill the void. At a time when the Irish still stopped for a pint at their local pub at least three times a week, everyone -- and especially the bartender -- had a pretty good idea who could be trusted. \"The managers of these retail outlets and public houses had a high degree of information about their customers,\" explains the economist Antoin Murphy. \"One does not after all serve drink to someone for years without discovering something of his liquid resources.\"\n>\n>In no time, people forged a radically decentralized monetary system with the country's 11,000 pubs as its key nodes and basic trust as its underlying mechanism. By the time the banks finally reopened in November, the Irish had printed an incredible \u00a35 billion in homemade currency. Some checks had been issued by companies, others were scribbled on the backs of cigar boxes, or even on toilet paper. According to historians, the reason the Irish were able to manage so well without banks was all down to social cohesion.\n>\n>So were there no problems at all?\n>\n>No, of course there were problems. Take the guy who bought a racehorse on credit and then paid the debt with money he won when his horse came in first -- basically, gambling with another person's cash. It sounds an awful lot like what banks do now, but then on a smaller scale. And, during the strike, Irish companies had a harder time acquiring capital for big investments. Indeed, the very fact that people began do-it-yourself banking makes it patently clear that they couldn't do without some kind of financial sector.\n>\n>But what they could do perfectly well without was all the smoke and mirrors, all the risky speculation, the glittering skyscrapers, and the towering bonuses paid out of taxpayers' pockets. \"Maybe, just maybe,\" the author and economist Umair Haque conjectures, \"banks need people a lot more than people need banks.\"", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 1, "downvote": 0, "text": "Sounds like Lightning is better in every way then.

And if they drop off the network, than yes, users who have had only one connection to the network through the disappeared hub, will have to open up a new channel to another node.

Currently valued around $10,000, Bitcoin BTC=BTSP could be poised for a similar whirlwind this time around, some say.\n\n\u201cIn case the government shuts down all local exchanges, investors can always go abroad and open an account there,\u201d said a South Korean student who declined to be named because of legal risks. \u201cI can ask my friends who study abroad or travel there myself. It\u2019s not that big of a problem.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency experts say the student probably has good reason to be relaxed. A ban could discourage new market entrants, but the anonymity of buyers and sellers and the ability to move digital assets anywhere in the world with a click makes it hard to impose restrictions on existing participants without a global consensus.\n\nPlaces like Singapore and Hong Kong maintain light regulations, while neighboring Japan has encouraged a vast ecosystem of companies and investors around digital assets by pioneering a set of rules for the industry. Germany has said national restrictions may be useless.\n\nVPNs, OFFLINE WALLETS\n\nAccording to industry experts, the first step to circumventing a ban is hiding IP addresses from authorities via virtual private networks (VPNs).\n\nTraders can then continue business as usual. Decentralized exchanges, such as Shapeshift or Stellar Dex, do not require identification and can be accessed from anywhere.\n\nCryptocurrency wallets such as Exodus and Jaxx are linked to such exchanges, so trading and storing the assets can still be anonymous. Authorities in countries with strong legal protections may need a warrant to check computers or smartphones for proof of such activity.\n\nEven then, unless caught in the act, the holder can claim no trading has taken place since the legislation was approved and has forgotten the password for the wallet.\n\n    Some decentralized exchanges offer derivative products that allow betting on the price of a cryptocurrency against a fiat currency, including the Korean won and Chinese yuan. But cashing out in fiat is not possible on such exchanges.\n\n    An option in that case is to trade all cryptocurrencies for a top one such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin, and sell it at one the 2,064 crypto ATMs in 61 countries, although the transaction fees can exceed 10 percent. If need be, coins can be stored on offline \u201cwallets\u201d the size of a USB stick.\n\nAlternatively, holders can open bank accounts in countries that have not banned Bitcoin, then join a local centralized exchange where they can trade cryptocurrencies for fiat.\n\n    \u201cI hold everything in a hard wallet the size of my thumb. I have copies of my private keys in a safe. I have accounts on four exchanges on three continents. If any government wants my money, good luck to them,\u201d said a Hong Kong-based investor who claims to hold \u201cabout $1 million\u201d in various cryptocurrencies.\n\nCROSSING BORDERS\nA 30-year-old nurse in Seoul said she had already switched to Hong Kong-based exchange Binance before the government\u2019s warnings hit the market. Company officers at Seoul-based exchanges say, anecdotally, such moves have accelerated.\n\n\u201cAll this could lead to serious money outflow and only the government is not aware of it,\u201d one officer said, requesting anonymity.\n\nSouth Korea accounts for between 5 and 15 percent of daily Bitcoin trading. The value of all Bitcoins is around $200 billion.\n\nIf opening accounts overseas proves difficult, friends, family or the local Bitcoin community can help. Another option is to find someone with access to an exchange - preferably using encrypted social media apps such as Whatsapp or Telegram - and sell to them at a discount. But fraud is a risk.\n\n\u201cThere could be a black market where people who can cash out offshore can pay you in won for your Bitcoins,\u201d said Aurelian Menant, chief executive of Hong-Kong based exchange Gatecoin.\n\nBut that leaves the door open to \u201cdodgy stuff,\u201d Menant said, adding that the fear of scams in the aftermath of a ban may deter new investors, potentially shrinking Korean trading volumes \u201cfrom billions to millions.\u201d", "likes": null}]}, {"time": "2018-01-18 21:17:24", "title": "India's love for bitcoin is strong, despite RBI and government warnings", "content": {"upvote": 75, "downvote": 0, "text": "", "views": null, "likes": null}, "comments": [{"upvote": 8, "downvote": 0, "text": "Indians are in fact very good HODlers.
