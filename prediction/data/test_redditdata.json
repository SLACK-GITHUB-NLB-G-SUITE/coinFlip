But in the American League, your manager can now indicate a deliberate base-on-balls, which means any batter who isn't holding altcoins can take a base without being pitched to.  If the batter leaves the base-path, is there any reason to think the baselines are valid anymore?  If the number of pitches declines, won't there be fewer sales jobs?  \n\n3.

I by no means do it as a fulltime job, and I by no means like crypto, but should you have any holdings in cryptocurrencies, the following information is extremely important.\n\nThe past few weeks showed the setup of a possible head and shoulders pattern. It seems crypto is in the right trough. What happens next really depends on how it behaves over the next couple days.\n\nAn educated guess is its running through a head and shoulders pattern since we already have established the following set points.\n\n- left shoulder around December 7th 16,500 realm\n\n- left dip, 13500 realm around December 10th\n\n- head, 19500 realm around December 17th.\n\nAnd it looks like we are establishing a neckline at around 12,000 right now. Which suggests a falling neckline. This is Bad. If you say this is good you are an idiot. If it is a head and shoulders pattern this is in, it will rebound to the 16000 realm to complete the right shoulder before it falls off a cliff to god knows where.\n\nThis bubble looks all set to pop, possibly in the next week or so. If I had any holdings, I would be watching the price very closely for signs that confirm this pattern.\n\nRecommended course of action if you hold crypto for some stupidly retarded reason: watch it over the next day or so, see if it sinks past 12000. If it does, *sell immediately to protect capital*. If it starts to rebound, target your sell point at around 15,000 to 16,000 as that should be where the right shoulder will peak. If you miss that you are fucked because bitcoin will fall off a cliff and the entire crypto market will crash. Optimistic guess that lower bounds of crash would be to low thousands high hundreds, since wall street is starting to poke around with it. But it could crash to 0 and die in a fire.\n\nSo, all of that is Assuming of course you could pull you money out quick enough, like any other security that exists ever. But crypto, being a retarded combination of volatile and not very liquid at all, probably won't let you get out with any sense of urgency, which could mean you miss the boat and lose biggly. So, with that fundamental taken into account.\n\n **Sell, sell it all and run for your life. Don't look back, leave. Get the fuck out. She's going down captain! You will not go to space today.**\n-\n\nHopefully that's memey enough for the densest of crypto heads to understand. \n\nIf your lucky enough to pull out in time, and still wish to invest, I encourage you to look into investing into green industries, robotics, and municipal bonds. The skills you all are learning still translate to other securities, and you stand to make money, as long as you don't make the same mistake of getting cocky and putting all of your eggs into a rocket powered basket without thinking about buying a parachute. And last bits of parting advice: when trading, the worst thing you can think is that 'this time its different' it never is. Don't let emotion make the decisions for you, base your decisions on the fundamentals and the technicals and not *hype trains*\n\nGood luck, and I hope you get out in time.\n\nEdit: sauce I am using is charts.bitcoin.com for clarity", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 5, "downvote": 0, "text": "And yet still up over 60% in the last month.

I am also curious how many folks have participated in parabolic trades. It seems pretty obvious to me that a 14k move that has trumped years of marketcap growth in less than 2 mos needs to be consolidated. I would think 8K seems like a screaming buy but also totally reasonable expectation over the next few months but plan to leg in at hopefully 13k and more heavily at 11k but the goal would be to load up at 8k. Almost all stock breakouts occur after periods of sustained consolidation so 20k 17k 14k and the daily freakouts all feels like noise until you go through this consolidation phase and you do not see sustained rallies during periods of high volatility so that also needs to dissipate which takes time. The flip side is i saw parabolic charts that look exactly like this in crude/agriculture in 08, DDD (3d printing company in 2012), GPRO 90 dollar stock went parabolic now trades at 9...my point is my strategy is to try and average cost around 10k put my stop at 5k eat a 50% loss if wrong and if it breaks below that know that its a bubble and the retail buyer we all need to get to 50k 100k will be burned and never coming back. Seems like not a lot of financial perspective being applied on this thread so curious if I am just not thinking about this the right way with this buyer base.

So actual trades don't account for those transactions.\n\nHowever, a lot of the transactions are likely to be people depositing and withdrawing money from exchanges because of the boom in trading activity. There's no evidence of Bitcoin adoption as a currency increasing dramatically recently - if anything, it's been falling off due to some of the problems.\n\n> If/when these TX go through, would they have any effect on the current price on exchanges if so? \n\nBecause most exchange trades happen off the blockchain, the only effect that Bitcoin transaction speed has on the BTC price is indirect.\n\nIf people are having trouble getting their money on and off exchanges, that's going to have an effect on prices. Interestingly, when the Bitfinex exchange recently was having trouble with deposits and withdrawals, its Bitcoin price ended up getting over $1000 higher than some other exchanges, but came back down again once the problems were (somewhat) mitigated.\n\n> Are these funds locked up until the transactions go through? \n\nIn theory, it's possible to \"cancel\" unconfirmed transactions, by reissuing the transaction with a higher fee (to make it more likely to be picked up by miners) and sending the money back to yourself. In practice, there can be challenges with this. Wallet software often doesn't support it, you may not control the transaction (if your money is on an exchange), etc.\n\n> Could someone have bought BTC at a lower price, but due to a delayed TX it goes through at the higher price?\n\n(Edit:) The trade itself is unaffected because (most) exchanges are centralized and not on the blockchain.

The burden of proof is on them to prove he has it/had it during the divorce. **DO NOT DO ANYTHING I LISTED HERE AS IT'S VERY VERY ILLEGAL AND COULD RESULT IN TIME IN JAIL** . But in theory here's how people could launder money via BTC (and why the government really sees BTC as a threat in money launders/drug trade). Also, future money laundering techniques will make future Breaking Bad a very very boring show, because there is no need for a carwash or chicken. \n\n\n1. Buy some pumped/overvalued altcoin on an exchange tied to your actual personal information.\n\n2. Scrub the alt coin (basically makes it untraceable)\n\n3. Move the scrubbed altcoin to another exchange with fake personal info. Sell the altcoin at a similar BTC cost. Rebuy a more valuable coin (like BTC/ETH/LTC/Monero) with the now untraceable fund and put it in a wallet (meaning, you're out very little - albeit susceptible to a huge crash when you're between cryptos).  We'll call this \"hidden BTC\". \n\n4. Wait for alt-coin to crash\n\n5. Buy a shitload of crashed altcoin post-crash.\n\n6. Move the same number of the altcoin back to exchange with your personal info.\n\n7. Sell alt-coin at a huge loss and put the low proceeds back into bank. You now have your \"loss\" and your \"hidden BTC\". Tell wife you lost a shitload of money on crypto to ensure she files for divorce. \n\n8. If asked about it by lawyer, say you were investing in crypto and due to the divorce you divested as you'd be incurring more expenses with a single income. \n\nOn the books, it looks like you bought an altcoin on an exchange, moved it out of your wallet, moved the same number of alt coins back to your wallet, and divested at a huge capital loss. In actuality, you only held the altcoin for a brief period of time and sold it right after. \n\nThe next problem is that you now have a bunch of BTC you need to legitimize.\n\n1. Post-divorce, buy a few mining rigs and set up an LLC. \n\n2. Use said mining rigs to mine whatever the fuck ICOs you want.\n\n3. Wait until a coin that originated AFTER the divorce moons. It might not be the coin you mined, but that doesn't matter.\n\n4. Calculate a reasonable number of coins you COULD have mined with the mining power you had. \n\n5. Use your \"hidden BTC\" to buy some alt coins and put it into a wallet. Scrub and transfer to another wallet. Ideally, do it in multiple transactions so you aren't as susceptible to a flash crash. \n\n6. Deposit alt coin onto an exchange and sell (an exchange outside of the US' jurisdiction would make it a shitload easier). Claim this as LLC profit from your 100% legit mining operation. Pay your fucking taxes. Make sure there's no way to prove you mined XYZ coin instead of PROFIT coin. \n\n\n7. Don't be stupid. Live to your prior living standards for years after. If you must flaunt your wealth, wait until you have a justification to do-so (ie a job promotion). Tell all your workers about your LLC. Establish a history before you suddenly become rich.\n\n8. Don't mention what you did to a single fucking soul. Whether it be your drinking buddies, family, or reddit. Everyone has a price. Someone could tip off the wife for a small percentage of her legal ruling. Not only would you risk losing the money, but now you also committed felonious money laundering. \n\nEDIT: Thought I'd add, I've never tried doing this before because I'm not involved in criminal activity (else I wouldn't have posted on my main account or even on an alt account). If someone has further insight as to why this wouldn't work, feel free to chime in. I'm basing my information solely on my experience with the crypto market + my knowledge of how US money laundering cases. I'm moreso sharing this theory to educate people on the very real reason governments/banks fear crypto. \n\nEDIT2: Also thought I'd do this for fun\n\nLIST OF CRIMINAL YOU PROBABLY WOULD COMMIT in addition to more: Tax evasion **multiple times**, even if you do pay taxes on the final product (because you didn't claim gains/losses on the exchange of alt-coins). Failure to disclose assets (to both the IRS and to the courts during the divorce). Perjury (at minimum, to the divorce lawyer). Conspiracy. And of course, money laundering. Potential identity theft laws in the foreign country which you use the exchange. Not to mention, the not criminal civil laws. \n", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 18, "downvote": 0, "text": "He looked like he died ", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 3, "downvote": 0, "text": "Don't fly what you can't afford to lose ;)", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 8, "downvote": 0, "text": "The real LPT is always in the comments.", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 9, "downvote": 0, "text": "It's going to be a bumpy ride for all cryptos until Christmas ", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 5, "downvote": 0, "text": ":(", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 36, "downvote": 0, "text": "It's much safer to take a ~~second~~ ~~third~~ fourth mortgage on the condo.", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 11, "downvote": 0, "text": "Can you imagine everytime you trade having to pay $50? xD", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 70, "downvote": 0, "text": "[deleted]", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 37, "downvote": 0, "text": "It's pogs.

This will make bitcoin unusable.\n\nEven if your government doesn't ban or crack down on bitcoin, a foreign government might, and due to the centralization of bitcoin mining, if China shuts down every bitcoin mine in its territory could easily cause a crisis in confidence which tanks the value of bitcoin.\n\nGovernment can legally hack your computer and monitor your internet use. They have already compromised things like Tor.\n\nIf there's a societal collapse, the power grid will fail and so will the telecoms network, there'll be no way to operate the blockchain and bitcoin becomes no different to any other encrypted number.

This would especially help with the fees on small transactions.\n* Abandon bitcoin for different technologies. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but that doesn't make it the best.

If you wanted to cash out What would be the general steps you go through to do it legally and safely?\n\nNo. You don't have to report holdings, you just report when any gain is realized. If you hold 1000 for 5 years, sold only 10 of them, then you report the profit you made on the price difference on just those 10 coins from 5 years ago to the date you sold them. You don't need to keep the IRS informed of your holdings or the 990 you are still sitting on, only realized gains. Crypto-to-crypto trades follow this policy as well, not just crypto-to-fiat. So if you sold your 10 BTC for a bunch of LTC, or whatever, that's the same as selling it for USD and you also need to calculate your capital gains when that executes.\n\nIf you want to cash out, you sign up for Gemini, Coinbase, or some other exchange that can do wire transfers of your FIAT currency to your bank. Simple as that. From there, in the US anyway, it's your legal duty to self-report any gains involved in selling the BTC->FIAT, as described above, and that's that.\n\nIt's actually pretty simple, though can be a pain in the ass if you have many many individual trades across multiple exchanges, but taxation on crypto follows already established tax policy for any other type of property in the US.

Here's an important detail:\n\n>Microsoft does not allow users to buy products with Bitcoin directly but **asks users to add a predetermined amount of dollars to their account balance, for which they can pay with Bitcoin**.\n\n~~So the headline is completely false. Microsoft is making a temporary move to allow users to load their account balance with Bitcoin rather than making direct individual purchases. Essentially users are buying non-refundable \"Microsoft Bucks\" with Bitcoin, and I think this is a very reasonable move considering the circumstances, and one that Steam should take as well.

Bitcoin and various Bitcoin companies are facing the luxury problem of being in very high demand. Luckily there are plenty of people working to address these problem. You all know about [Lightning Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ojkoz/lightning_network_megathread/) which is progressing constantly, and we will also see the [Rootstock \\(RSK\\)](http://rsk.co/) federated sidechain platform launch soon as well, both very exciting!\n\n**EDIT:** Still researching this since the article is such poorly written clickbait.

At least one person has told me that Bitcoin is not available as a payment option when trying to buy a 1 year xbox live subscription. I've asked [@csuwildcat](https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/950107454628552704) (Head of Decentralized Identity at Microsoft) to clarify and he's currently unaware of any changes but is looking into it.

Neither does /u/FraggleRockRefugee. This indicates that the story, while very poorly written, may indeed be true.\n\n**EDIT 4:** More reports of the lack of a Bitcoin payment option on the Microsoft site.

Hell, it'd probably cause a pretty significant devaluation in Bitcoin Cash, as people return to Bitcoin, although that's not the goal.

The team behind Bitcoin Core just happens to be the most active and competent team, so a majority of users choose their software. Any competent programmer can contribute to Bitcoin's development.\n\nThe only reason why Bitcoin transactions are expensive right now is because of Bitcoin's overwhelming success and because of spam transactions. SegWit addresses this directly. If all wallet apps and exchanges offered SegWit, the transactions would be affordable again while we wait for second-layer scaling solutions like the Lightning Network.\n\nBitcoin Cash's only advantages is that it allows for bigger blocks and that its user base is much smaller than Bitcoin's, making Bitcoin Cash transactions much cheaper at the moment.\n\nBitcoin could kill Bitcoin Cash overnight by allowing miners to mine bigger blocks. They don't do it because it isn't a sustainable scaling solution. You evidently don't want everyone's morning coffee to be recorded in perpetuity on thousands of computers, it's a completely unreasonable waste of resources. If Bitcoin Cash became successful and was adopted widely for everyday transaction, its blocks would have to become huge, which would inevitably lead to dangerous centralization.\n\nThe team behind the Bitcoin Core software chose a much more reasonable route. With SegWit, they reduced the size of Bitcoin transactions so that more transactions can be crammed into each block. Implementing Schnorr signatures will result in another large efficiency gain. Then there's the Lightning Network that will allow users to make instantaneous and very cheap transactions.\n\nThese three technologies will make Bitcoin much more efficient and scalable than Bitcoin Cash.

Everyone should have been expecting a crash since it hit 10k. I never expected it to go above 30k without first a major crash below 10k. Anything is possible but treat a better outcome than previous bubbles as a bonus, not an expectation. \n\n\nThere is always the \"this time it's different\" mentality. This time it's because of big money entering the scene in a number of relatively small ways. Don't fall into the trap. Be prepared for a crash at every shiny 10x of the last bubble high.\n\n\nI'm not saying that this time will be the same but don't go in expecting it to not crash because you could very well be disappointed. If you think you might become suicidal if it goes down to 2-5k, look at the big picture and either have patience after the crash or hedge against it.\n\n\n2018 is going to be a very interesting year for Bitcoin. This may garner attention like it has never done before. So it is possible it could go up sooner than later but the last crash down below 1k lasted almost 2 years and people then were saying it would be different. But even so, prepare for the possibility of this being *the* crash because historically, there has always been a big crash before the next 10x.

I\u2019ve followed Bitcoin for years, including the last time the bubble popped in 2012/2013.  It\u2019s the same story now as it was then.\n\n\nPeople taking about \u201canalytics\u201d and \u201cprice charts\u201d want to give Bitcoin the veneer of legitimacy, but in all honesty this thing could crash down to $50 a coin (or less) just as easily as it could go to $20k.  Nothing about it\u2019s price is based remotely on anything \u201creal\u201d.  \n\n\nPeople just need to cut their losses and sell.  People hoping for the price to get back to where they bought in may luck out.  However, each time this bubble inflates and pops, the wider investing public becomes more aware of Bitcoin\u2019s true nature (a pump and dump).  And thus they\u2019re *less* likely to buy in the next time.  And now some folks on Wall Street is getting burned on it, so the institutional money is going to stay away as well (or they\u2019ll just short it because they know there are plenty of suckers on Main Street that they can take for a ride).", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 5, "downvote": 0, "text": "This", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 2, "downvote": 0, "text": "coinbase, or use bitquick.co to  do cash deposit bank transfer", "likes": null}, {"upvote": 2, "downvote": 0, "text": "Coinbase.

If those same cases of water were $100 each, I may buy only 1 or 2 cases.
